	\section{Introduction}
	The project is about creating a system for managing contact tracing among multiple IoT devices. Contacts happens when two devices are within the same broadcast domain.The contacts among devices are reported periodically to the backend on the regular Internet. Whenever a device signals an event of interest, all the devices that had a contact with it must be notified. The project is based on the fact that all nodes are constantly reachable from a static IoT device that acts like an IPv6 border router.   


	\section{Implementation}
	\subsection{Technologies used}
	The implementation requires to use the COOJA simulator of ContikiNG for the network simulation of the IoT devices. For the backend we decide to use Akka. We decide to use publish/subscribe architecture style for the communication between the simulator and Akka. The communication happens through MQTT both from Akka either COOJA. We decide also to use the broker Mosquitto, that are (in our case) already on the machine, to finalize the publish/subscribe through MQTT.
	
	\subsection{ContikiNG}
	For the simulation of the IoT devices we use nodes to publish and subscribe and a rpl border router to allow nodes to connect to the broker on our machine. Nodes implement two main functionalities:
	one is to send in broadcast to all other visible nodes its own id, this is implemented:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	First,  nodes use a state machine to connect with mqtt to the message broker and then publish data periodically(these data represent the events of interest)      
		\item   Second,	 is to send in broadcast to all other visible nodes its own id, this is implemented using udp on an IP address set to the link local all-nodes multi-cast address. When a node receives this kind of message, it calls a callback, that allows that node to publish its own id and the id of the sender of the message if it can
		\item	Third, nodes receive data from their subscription  through MQTT	
	\end{itemize}
	
	In our implementation there are three topics: one when two people are in contact, one for the event of interest and one for the notification. Our nodes publish on the first two topic, while are subscribed to the third one, vice versa for Akka that is subscribed to the first two topics while for the third one publish. When a node from the simulation send a publish on a topic the broker on our machine takes care to publish it on a broker server, we decide to publish on test.mosquitto.org:1883. Then when a message arrives on Akka, it is handled in different ways based on the topic from which it receive the message. If the message comes is a contact message our server saves the message; if it is a message of interest, our server retrieves the sender of the message and publish a notification for each node that was in cantact with the sender. In the end these notification arrives to all nodes but only nodes that was in contact print something, this print is made looking the data of the message.
	
	\subsection{Akka}
	The backend server is realized by using the Akka middleware and its composed by three main parts:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the server main file, that bootstrap the server and the actor hierarchy. At launch, it initialize the server actor, then it creates the MQTT connection with the broker, subscribes to the topics where the IoT devices publish the messages and provides the functions to deserialize their json content to build actual message instances for the server actors.
		\item the server actor, that has the references to all device actors, which are instanciated as children of it. It receive all the messages from the server main and distribute them to the correct device actor. If the IoT device that have sent the message is not present in the actor hierarchy, the respective device actor is created as a child of the server actor. When it receives notification messages from the device actors, it sends a message on the apposite topic of MQTT, so that IoT devices can get the notification. Server actor also perform a simple fault tolerance strategy, restarting the device actors in case of any exception, keeping also their previous state so that contact list is not lost.
		\item the device actors, that represent a digital abstraction of the physical IoT devices. In our case they simply store the set of ids of devices with which they have contacts. When they receive contact messages they simply add the ids to the set. When they receive an event message, they produce and send notification messages to the server, one for each device to contact.
